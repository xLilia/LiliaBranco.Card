      <h1>Hi ! I'm L√≠lia Branco, 25 üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è</h1>
      <p>I'm an indie video game developer !</p>
      <p>I've had a very strong drive for expressing my inner worlds and stories since forever.</p>
      <p>I started exploring video game creation on my own as a kid using (unexpectedly) PowerPoint!
        I played with the software as if it was another game on my WindowsXP PC and built a small set of "choose your own adventure" games with ClipArt characters animated by powerpoint sequence animations and page transitions. Life was good.</p>
      <p>Growing up, through my school years, I scribbled ideas for games and virtual worlds during class. 
        On the 5th grade I found out about "Scratch" and had my first taste of Visual Programming. Eventually taught myself how to write small games in 2D and 3D using "GameMaker" in the 7th grade.</p>
      <p>Through Highschool I taught myself javascript & html, C, C++, Java, Python and a bit of 3D modeling and decided to follow my dream by pursuing a bachelor degree in "Game Design & Development" at university.</p>
      <p>For the university's final year I went to Finland for 5 months in an erasmus program, and for the final project I wrote a small game engine/framework (_Nameless), from the ground up, using C++ & OpenGL, which was graded 19/20. I was happy.</p> 
      <p>The 4 years that followed were quite hectic. I entered the job market and got myself a job at a prestigious "Big Name Banking Software Company". 
        For my surprise it wasn't as dreamy. Whenever I had the time and energy at the end of the day or vacations, 
        I would hone my skills at Game Programming & Design, Software & Graphics Engineering, 3D Art from modeling to rigging, writing stories and composing music for my small prototypes and projects, 
        in an attempt to eventually go full Indie.</p>
      <p>At the job, I became Team Lead for the duration of a year but decided to leave the position, in search for something more meaningfull.</p>
      <p>Did some soul searching, traveled to Germany with my girlfriend, found a lot of meaning in Virtual Reality, started working on my new (Comphi) Game Engine with VR in mind, and built some VR prototypes in Unity and Unreal.</p>
      <p>And for now I'm looking forward to continue supporting my dream while working at the VideoGames Industry.</p>
      <p>‚óã‚óã‚óã</p>
